# Hash_Table with optimization
In this project I have made a hash table for english to russian vocabulary. 
There are two steps of this project: 
1) Create Hash Table for fast word finding
2) Optimize code with using assembler code 

## Writing optimization

First of all we should choose which type of hash table we would write. For this task I have chosen Separate chaining with linked lists because of easier choose of hash functions, but it is also perfect to use open addressing because our hash table is concieved with constant size.

So, the structure of our project simplified will look in this way
